Additional curation effort has occurred to ensure reliability and scalability on many different architectures each across 4 various problem sizes of increasing computation complexity.

Previous work~\cite{johnston2017embedded} has shown that energy consumption of accelerator devices, at least in the embedded space and on compute-bound applications, is strongly correlated with execution time.
Extending this investigation into energy usage over communication-bound and memory-bound problems is essential, since many scientific codes targeted for HPC and supercomputing systems have these characteristics.
Additionally, given the candidate accelerators are proposed as future components on such systems and the nature of these codes, an evaluation of energy consumption on a wide range of accelerators is essential.
