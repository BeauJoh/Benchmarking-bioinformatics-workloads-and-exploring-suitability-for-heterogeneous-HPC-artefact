Barnes et al.~\cite{barnes2016evaluating} collected a representative set of applications from the current NERSC workload to guide optimization for Knights Landing in the Cori supercomputer.
As it is not always feasible to perform such a detailed performance study of the capabilities of different computational devices, the benchmarks described in this paper may give a rough understanding of device performance and limitations.

Martineau et al.~\cite{martineau2016performance} collected a suite of benchmarks and three mini-apps to evaluate Clang OpenMP 4.5 support for NVIDIA GPUs.

Lopez et al.~\cite{lopez2015examining} Scalable Heterogeneous Computing benchmark suite.

The NAS parallel benchmarks~\cite{bailey1991parallel} follow a `pencil-and-paper` approach, specifying the computational problem but leaving implementation choices such as language, data structures and algorithms to the user.
The benchmarks include varied kernels and applications which allow a more nuanced evaluation of a complete HPC system, however, the unconstrained approach does not readily support direct performance comparison between different hardware accelerators using a single set of codes.
