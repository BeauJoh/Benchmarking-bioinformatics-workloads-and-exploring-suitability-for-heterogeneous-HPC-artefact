%LibSciBench and performance counters

We measured kernel execution time and device energy over 50 runs, for multiple problem sizes (see \S\ref{ssec:setting_sizes}).
To help understand the timings, the following hardware counters were also collected:
\begin{itemize}
	\item total instructions and IPC (Instructions Per Cycle);
	\item L1 and L2 data cache misses;
	\item total L3 cache events in the form of request rate (requests / instructions), miss rate (misses / instructions), and miss ratio (misses/requests);
	\item data TLB (Translation Look-aside Buffer) miss rate (misses / instructions); and
	\item branch instructions and branch mispredictions.
\end{itemize}

A sample of 50 iterations was collected for each measurement.
Only the kernel execution times and energies are presented in the final results.

Energy measurements were taken on Intel platforms using the RAPL PAPI module, and on Nvidia GPUs using the NVML PAPI module.
