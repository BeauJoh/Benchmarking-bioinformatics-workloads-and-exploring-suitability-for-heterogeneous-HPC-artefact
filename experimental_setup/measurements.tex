%LibSciBench and performance counters

We measured execution time and energy for individual OpenCL kernels within each benchmark.
Each benchmark was run 50 times for each problem size (see \S\ref{ssec:setting_sizes}) for both execution time and energy measurements.
\todo[inline]{for a minimum of two seconds (when we have those results)}
To help understand the timings, the following hardware counters were also collected:
\begin{itemize}
	\item total instructions and IPC (Instructions Per Cycle);
	\item L1 and L2 data cache misses;
	\item total L3 cache events in the form of request rate (requests / instructions), miss rate (misses / instructions), and miss ratio (misses/requests);
	\item data TLB (Translation Look-aside Buffer) miss rate (misses / instructions); and
	\item branch instructions and branch mispredictions.
\end{itemize}
For each benchmark we also measured memory transfer times between host and device, however, only the kernel execution times and energies are presented here.

Energy measurements were taken on Intel platforms using the RAPL PAPI module, and on Nvidia GPUs using the NVML PAPI module.
