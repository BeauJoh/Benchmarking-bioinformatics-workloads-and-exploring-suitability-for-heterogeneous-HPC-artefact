Our experiments were conducted on three hardware platforms:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a modern quad-core Intel Skylake Core i7-6700K CPU with a clock frequency of \SI{4.3}{\giga\hertz};
	\item an older quad-core Intel Nehalem Core i7 960 CPU with a clock frequency of \SI{3.2}{\giga\hertz}; and
	\item a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU with a clock frequency of \SI{1835}{\mega\hertz}.
\end{enumerate}
\todo[inline]{confirm that tests were run at highest clock frequency}

OpenCL version 1.2 was used for all experiments.
On the CPUs we used the Intel OpenCL driver version 6.3, provided in the tarball intel\_sdk\_for\_opencl\_2015\_ubuntu\_5.3.0.1904\_x64.tgz.
\todo[inline]{confirm mismatch 5.3 -> 6.3}
On the GPU we used the Nvidia OpenCL driver version 375.66, provided as part of CUDA 8.0.61.
Hyperthreading was disabled for all CPU experiments.
